✅ 1. Understanding Asymptotic Notation

📌 What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation describes the upper bound (worst-case growth rate) of an algorithm’s time or space complexity in terms of input size n.

It helps developers:

Estimate performance as input grows

Compare efficiency between algorithms

Choose the right algorithm for large-scale systems like e-commerce platforms

✅ 2. Setup

Why is a Product class needed?

The Product class acts as a data model that encapsulates essential attributes of a product (such as ID, name, and category). This abstraction makes it easy to manage, sort, and search through product records. Without such a class, product data would be unstructured and harder to process efficiently.

What attributes are suitable for enabling search functionality?

Typical attributes useful for search include:

productId: A unique identifier (helps with exact searches).

productName: Enables keyword or full-text search.

category: Helps in filtered or grouped searches (e.g., "Electronics", "Footwear").

(Optional) price, brand, rating: Can enhance search and sorting relevance.

These fields make searches flexible and user-friendly by enabling different filters and views.

✅ 3. Implementation

How is Linear Search implemented on an array of products?

In linear search, each product in the array is checked one by one to see if it matches the search term. For example, if you're searching for "Shoes", the algorithm goes through each element:


for (int i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
    if (products[i].getProductName().equalsIgnoreCase(searchItem)) {
        return i; // Found at this index
    }
}
It’s simple but inefficient for large datasets (O(n) time complexity).

Why do we need to sort the array before applying Binary Search?

Binary Search relies on sorted data to divide the search space in half at each step. If the array is not sorted (e.g., by product name), binary search can return incorrect results. So, sorting is a prerequisite for binary search to function correctly.

What are the key differences between Linear and Binary search?

Feature	Linear Search	Binary Search
Time Complexity	O(n)	O(log n)
Sorting Needed	❌ Not needed	✅ Required
Speed on large data	Slow	Fast
Implementation	Simple	Slightly more complex
Use Case	Small or unsorted datasets	Large, sorted datasets

Binary search is significantly more efficient, but only when the dataset is sorted.



✅ 4. Analysis: Time Complexity

Algorithm	Time Complexity (Best)	Time Complexity (Worst)
Linear Search	O(1)	O(n)
Binary Search	O(1)	O(log n)

💡 Which is better for E-commerce platforms?

# Use Linear Search:

For small datasets

When the list is unsorted


# Use Binary Search:

For large datasets

When data is pre-sorted

Faster and scales better with large product catalogs

## 1. Understanding Asymptotic Notation

**Big O Notation**: Describes the upper bound time complexity of an algorithm

## 4. Analysis: Time Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm        | Best Case | Worst Case |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Linear Search    | O(1)      | O(n)       |
| Binary Search    | O(1)      | O(log n)   |

**Conclusion**: Binary Search is better for large datasets if sorted.
